# Brief: google-indexing-api-node-js

State: article reviewed. Original brief base Git revision: cf640ac56542cca8850b2ce3ab773f35c8910e21.
Owner: product_writer. Brief reviewer: sources_reviewer. Coordinator: request_content_lead.

Read [COPY](../../COPY.md), [SOURCES](../../SOURCES.md), [VERIFIED-CLAIMS](../../VERIFIED-CLAIMS.md), [SCREENSHOTS](../../SCREENSHOTS.md), and the root glossary.

- File: `guides/google-indexing-api-node-js.md`; stable route: `/google-indexing-api-node-js`.
- Reader: JavaScript developer with reviewed prerequisites.
- Question: How do I notify Google from Node.js?
- Outcome: Run a small scoped client and interpret its result.
- Claim IDs: GOOGLE-01 through GOOGLE-10. Source dates and qualifications remain in the shared ledger.
- Search evidence: no current measured demand. NuxtSEO unavailable; locale/Site unresolved. Old research is discovery only.
- Contribution: A small runnable Node.js client with captured mock responses demonstrates payload and error interpretation without claiming live Google access.
- Progressive outline: Prerequisites; current library installation; one eligible URL example; metadata distinction; structured failure handling; link bulk workflow.
- Exclusions: unsupported content efficacy, ranking promises, undocumented detection signals, invented tests, unrelated roadmap, and unverified pricing.
- Related articles, only at a natural decision: google-indexing-api-tutorial, bulk-submit-urls-google-indexing-api.
- Navigation: Google Indexing Guides; retain current route. Do not add Markdown H1 beneath the rendered title.
- Dates: preserve publishedAt. Set updatedAt only after actual rewrite and review.
- Visual plan: No screenshot required for this decision-focused article. Add only if a real control/result materially clarifies the task.
- Execution boundary: examples must pass syntax/type or mocked protocol checks as appropriate. No authenticated API submission is claimed. A sequential loop is not multipart batching; a per-run limit is not durable project-wide quota.
- Checks: factual review before humanization; both humanize passes with changes recorded; post-humanize meaning review; one H1, metadata/canonical, internal links/fragments, desktop/mobile render, code/table overflow, FAQ/schema consistency.

## Current review status

Article reviewed on 15 September 2026. Accepted Git revision: `89dd568eda983e68e7132dd2265ef8a6e54fc7f4`.
Article SHA256 file digest at that revision: `d7fc960e49e31363f5f6b3d22a5948d868cccb10d643890eb002a34a3186fe2a`.
sources_reviewer approved factual and humanized prose, then reviewed the final formatting-only revision.
Shared coordinator acceptance and rendered checks are recorded in the [collection ledger](../README.md).
Article PR: [#77](https://github.com/harlan-zw/requestindexing.com/pull/77), stacked on foundation [#75](https://github.com/harlan-zw/requestindexing.com/pull/75).
Later revisions require review of their changes. This record does not approve an unreviewed future head.
Merge and live publication are not recorded as complete. Authenticated Google actions remain untested.

## Reviewed example contract

Use the current official Node client: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client and https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs.
Runtime: Node.js24 LTS in this run. Record exact installed googleapis version in evidence.
Choose an ES module `.mjs` file using GoogleAuth with GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and indexing scope.
Run server-side; keep the service-account key outside Git. Show installation, credential variable and invocation.
Instantiate the actual installed client and intercept its transport. Check URL, POST method, URL_UPDATED body, and interpreted response.
No authenticated submission. A transport mock establishes client behavior only.

## History, 15 September 2026: Factual draft handoff

Writer: product_writer, 15 September 2026. Draft based on reviewed brief and claims. Preserved route/publication date where present; updated review date. Removed unsupported assertions and duplicate comparison H1s.
At this handoff, factual review was requested before humanization; it was subsequently approved. No authenticated actions or manufactured screenshots.
Executable JS extracted from article matches the tested scratch artifact. Node24.18.0/googleapis181.0.0 instantiated actual client; mocked GoogleAuth credential provider and nock transport, network disabled. Success, structured429, and mixed sequential outcomes passed, including duplicate input suppression. No live auth/Google behavior established. Evidence: private code-checks/results.log.

## History, 15 September 2026: Humanize and meaning review

All eight factual drafts approved by sources_reviewer on 15 September 2026, including conditional vendor API scope and per-user quota fixes.
Surface pass: corrected number/version spacing, replaced formal or padded wording, retained protocol names.
Structural pass: kept the common task first; removed repeated conclusions and editorial process details from the opening. Specific edits below.
- 'This guide uses Node.js24 and `googleapis`181.0.0, with the request checked against intercepted HTTP responses.' → 'The example uses Node.js 24 and `googleapis` 181.0.0.'
- 'Keep those states separate if you store results in a database.' → 'If you store the result, keep that receipt separate from indexing status.'
- 'Extend it only when needed' → 'When you have several URLs'
Meaning recheck: claim scopes, URLs, dates, examples and execution limitations preserved. Vendor mechanism uncertainty and per-user tool denominator retained. Executable code unchanged. Independent humanized review was requested at this stage and subsequently approved.

Writer mobile390 check after humanization: oneH1, document width390, no overflow. Full-page screenshot inspected, including wrapped code or comparison table. Private screenshot ri-batch-google-indexing-api-node-js.png; lead subsequently completed the collection route and viewport checks.
