# Brief: google-indexing-api-node-js

State: brief reviewed. Parent revision: cf640ac56542cca8850b2ce3ab773f35c8910e21.
Owner: product_writer. Brief reviewer: sources_reviewer. Coordinator: request_content_lead.

Read [COPY](../../COPY.md), [SOURCES](../../SOURCES.md), [VERIFIED-CLAIMS](../../VERIFIED-CLAIMS.md), [SCREENSHOTS](../../SCREENSHOTS.md), and the root glossary.

- File: `guides/google-indexing-api-node-js.md`; stable route: `/google-indexing-api-node-js`.
- Reader: JavaScript developer with reviewed prerequisites.
- Question: How do I notify Google from Node.js?
- Outcome: Run a small scoped client and interpret its result.
- Claim IDs: GOOGLE-01 through GOOGLE-10. Source dates and qualifications remain in the shared ledger.
- Search evidence: no current measured demand. NuxtSEO unavailable; locale/Site unresolved. Old research is discovery only.
- Contribution: A small runnable Node.js client with captured mock responses demonstrates payload and error interpretation without claiming live Google access.
- Progressive outline: Prerequisites; current library installation; one eligible URL example; metadata distinction; structured failure handling; link bulk workflow.
- Exclusions: unsupported content efficacy, ranking promises, undocumented detection signals, invented tests, unrelated roadmap, and unverified pricing.
- Related articles, only at a natural decision: google-indexing-api-tutorial, bulk-submit-urls-google-indexing-api.
- Navigation: Google Indexing Guides; retain current route. Do not add Markdown H1 beneath the rendered title.
- Dates: preserve publishedAt. Set updatedAt only after actual rewrite and review.
- Visual plan: No screenshot required for this decision-focused article. Add only if a real control/result materially clarifies the task.
- Execution boundary: examples must pass syntax/type or mocked protocol checks as appropriate. No authenticated API submission is claimed. A sequential loop is not multipart batching; a per-run limit is not durable project-wide quota.
- Checks: factual review before humanization; both humanize passes with changes recorded; post-humanize meaning review; one H1, metadata/canonical, internal links/fragments, desktop/mobile render, code/table overflow, FAQ/schema consistency.

## Reviewed example contract

Use the current official Node client: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client and https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs.
Runtime: Node.js24 LTS in this run. Record exact installed googleapis version in evidence.
Choose an ES module `.mjs` file using GoogleAuth with GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and indexing scope.
Run server-side; keep the service-account key outside Git. Show installation, credential variable and invocation.
Instantiate the actual installed client and intercept its transport. Check URL, POST method, URL_UPDATED body, and interpreted response.
No authenticated submission. A transport mock establishes client behavior only.
