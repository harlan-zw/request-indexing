# Brief: google-indexing-api-quota

State: article reviewed. Original brief base Git revision: cf640ac56542cca8850b2ce3ab773f35c8910e21.
Owner: product_writer. Brief reviewer: sources_reviewer. Coordinator: request_content_lead.

Read [COPY](../../COPY.md), [SOURCES](../../SOURCES.md), [VERIFIED-CLAIMS](../../VERIFIED-CLAIMS.md), [SCREENSHOTS](../../SCREENSHOTS.md), and the root glossary.

- File: `guides/google-indexing-api-quota.md`; stable route: `/google-indexing-api-quota`.
- Reader: Developer debugging quotas.
- Question: Which limit applies to this request?
- Outcome: Separate project quota, testing approval, per-minute limits and app limits.
- Claim IDs: GOOGLE-02, GOOGLE-03, GOOGLE-08, GOOGLE-10, GOOGLE-11, PRODUCT-03. Source dates and qualifications remain in the shared ledger.
- Search evidence: no current measured demand. NuxtSEO unavailable; locale/Site unresolved. Old research is discovery only.
- Contribution: A ten-notification example shows why one HTTP batch still uses ten project requests, while app and Google reset clocks stay separate.
- Progressive outline: Identify interface; quota table scoped to project; Pacific reset example with timezone caveat; approval form; diagnose reason; batching arithmetic; no invented failure charging.
- Exclusions: unsupported content efficacy, ranking promises, undocumented detection signals, invented tests, unrelated roadmap, and unverified pricing.
- Related articles, only at a natural decision: bulk-submit-urls-google-indexing-api, google-indexing-api-tutorial.
- Navigation: Google Indexing Guides; retain current route. Do not add Markdown H1 beneath the rendered title.
- Dates: preserve publishedAt. Set updatedAt only after actual rewrite and review.
- Visual plan: No screenshot required for this decision-focused article. Add only if a real control/result materially clarifies the task.
- Execution boundary: examples must pass syntax/type or mocked protocol checks as appropriate. No authenticated API submission is claimed. A sequential loop is not multipart batching; a per-run limit is not durable project-wide quota.
- Checks: factual review before humanization; both humanize passes with changes recorded; post-humanize meaning review; one H1, metadata/canonical, internal links/fragments, desktop/mobile render, code/table overflow, FAQ/schema consistency.

## History, 15 September 2026: Factual draft handoff

Writer: product_writer, 15 September 2026. Draft based on reviewed brief and claims. Preserved route/publication date where present; updated review date. Removed unsupported assertions and duplicate comparison H1s.
At this handoff, factual review was requested before humanization; it was subsequently approved. No authenticated actions or manufactured screenshots.

## History, 15 September 2026: Humanize and meaning review

All eight factual drafts approved by sources_reviewer on 15 September 2026, including conditional vendor API scope and per-user quota fixes.
Surface pass: corrected number/version spacing, replaced formal or padded wording, retained protocol names.
Structural pass: kept the common task first; removed repeated conclusions and editorial process details from the opening. Specific edits below.
- 'This guide does not establish whether each possible failure consumes quota.' → 'The sources checked here do not establish a charging rule for every possible failure.'
- "Likewise, a script's local counter only knows about its own run." → "A script's local counter only knows about its own run."
Meaning recheck: claim scopes, URLs, dates, examples and execution limitations preserved. Vendor mechanism uncertainty and per-user tool denominator retained. Executable code unchanged. Independent humanized review was requested at this stage and subsequently approved.
