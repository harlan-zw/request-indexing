# Brief: bulk-submit-urls-google-indexing-api

State: article reviewed. Original brief base Git revision: cf640ac56542cca8850b2ce3ab773f35c8910e21.
Owner: product_writer. Brief reviewer: sources_reviewer. Coordinator: request_content_lead.

Read [COPY](../../COPY.md), [SOURCES](../../SOURCES.md), [VERIFIED-CLAIMS](../../VERIFIED-CLAIMS.md), [SCREENSHOTS](../../SCREENSHOTS.md), and the root glossary.

- File: `guides/bulk-submit-urls-google-indexing-api.md`; stable route: `/bulk-submit-urls-google-indexing-api`.
- Reader: Developer with working single notification.
- Question: How do I send multiple eligible notifications safely?
- Outcome: Distinguish multipart batching from sequential sends and handle each result.
- Claim IDs: GOOGLE-01, GOOGLE-02, GOOGLE-03, GOOGLE-05, GOOGLE-08, GOOGLE-10. Source dates and qualifications remain in the shared ledger.
- Search evidence: no current measured demand. NuxtSEO unavailable; locale/Site unresolved. Old research is discovery only.
- Contribution: A worked batch response explains independent inner results, contrasted with sequential calls and the missing cross-process budget boundary.
- Progressive outline: Eligibility and actual available quota; ten URLs cost ten calls; multipart format versus simple sequential loop; inspect every part; execution order and durable shared budgeting caveats.
- Exclusions: unsupported content efficacy, ranking promises, undocumented detection signals, invented tests, unrelated roadmap, and unverified pricing.
- Related articles, only at a natural decision: google-indexing-api-node-js, google-indexing-api-quota.
- Navigation: Google Indexing Guides; retain current route. Do not add Markdown H1 beneath the rendered title.
- Dates: preserve publishedAt. Set updatedAt only after actual rewrite and review.
- Visual plan: No screenshot required for this decision-focused article. Add only if a real control/result materially clarifies the task.
- Execution boundary: examples must pass syntax/type or mocked protocol checks as appropriate. No authenticated API submission is claimed. A sequential loop is not multipart batching; a per-run limit is not durable project-wide quota.
- Checks: factual review before humanization; both humanize passes with changes recorded; post-humanize meaning review; one H1, metadata/canonical, internal links/fragments, desktop/mobile render, code/table overflow, FAQ/schema consistency.

sources_reviewer approved factual and humanized prose, then reviewed the final formatting-only revision.
Shared coordinator acceptance and rendered checks are recorded in the [collection ledger](../README.md).
Article PR: [#77](https://github.com/harlan-zw/requestindexing.com/pull/77), stacked on foundation [#75](https://github.com/harlan-zw/requestindexing.com/pull/75).
Later revisions require review of their changes. This record does not approve an unreviewed future head.
Merge and live publication are not recorded as complete. Authenticated Google actions remain untested.

## Reviewed example contract

Use the current official Node client: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client and https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs.
Runtime: Node.js24 LTS in this run. Record exact installed googleapis version in evidence.
Choose an ES module `.mjs` file using GoogleAuth with GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and indexing scope.
Run server-side; keep the service-account key outside Git. Show installation, credential variable and invocation.
Instantiate the actual installed client and intercept its transport. Check URL, POST method, URL_UPDATED body, and interpreted response.
No authenticated submission. A transport mock establishes client behavior only.

Concrete artifact: sequential sender over eligible input URLs, reporting each success/failure. It sends separate requests.
Show multipart only as a labeled static wire-format example, not an untested runnable parser.
Mock mixed results. Never mark skipped items successful or describe a local cap as a project-wide quota reservation.

## History, 15 September 2026: Factual draft handoff

Writer: product_writer, 15 September 2026. Draft based on reviewed brief and claims. Preserved route/publication date where present; updated review date. Removed unsupported assertions and duplicate comparison H1s.
At this handoff, factual review was requested before humanization; it was subsequently approved. No authenticated actions or manufactured screenshots.
Executable JS extracted from article matches the tested scratch artifact. Node24.18.0/googleapis181.0.0 instantiated actual client; mocked GoogleAuth credential provider and nock transport, network disabled. Success, structured429, and mixed sequential outcomes passed, including duplicate input suppression. No live auth/Google behavior established. Evidence: private code-checks/results.log.

## History, 15 September 2026: Humanize and meaning review

All eight factual drafts approved by sources_reviewer on 15 September 2026, including conditional vendor API scope and per-user quota fixes.
Surface pass: corrected number/version spacing, replaced formal or padded wording, retained protocol names.
Structural pass: kept the common task first; removed repeated conclusions and editorial process details from the opening. Specific edits below.
- 'Both approaches consume quota per inner API request.' → 'In either case, Google counts the individual API requests.'
- 'This deliberately continues after a failure so each input receives a result.' → 'The loop continues after a failure so each input receives a result.'
- 'Consider this synthetic outcome: job42 receives `200`, while job43 receives a quota error.' → 'For a synthetic example, job 42 receives `200` while job 43 receives a quota error.'
- 'This small sender disables automatic retries and is not a production quota scheduler.' → 'Automatic retries are disabled. You must plan shared quota accounting separately.'
Meaning recheck: claim scopes, URLs, dates, examples and execution limitations preserved. Vendor mechanism uncertainty and per-user tool denominator retained. Executable code unchanged. Independent humanized review was requested at this stage and subsequently approved.

Writer mobile390 check after humanization: oneH1, document width390, no overflow. Full-page screenshot inspected, including wrapped code or comparison table. Private screenshot ri-batch-bulk-submit-urls-google-indexing-api.png; lead subsequently completed the collection route and viewport checks.
