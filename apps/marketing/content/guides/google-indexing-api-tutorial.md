Start with one eligible URL, such as a real job listing at `https://example.com/jobs/42`. Google supports the Indexing API for `JobPosting`, or `BroadcastEvent` embedded in `VideoObject`. Ordinary blog posts need [a different workflow](/indexing-api-for-blog-posts).

Google's default quota covers onboarding and testing. Additional approval is required for usage and resource provisioning; use the form linked from [Google's approval page](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quota-pricing).

## Set up credentials and property access

[Google's prerequisites](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/prereqs) separate Cloud setup from Search Console ownership. Complete both before running the script.

### Enable the Indexing API

Create or select a Google Cloud project. In the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/indexing.googleapis.com), find **Web Search Indexing API** (1) and enable it for that project. If the API is already enabled, you will see **Manage** and **API Enabled** (2).

### Create the service account and key

Open **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create service account**. Give the account a name (1). The **Permissions (optional)** step (2) grants Cloud IAM roles; it is not required for this Indexing API setup.

</figure>

After creating the account, open its **Keys** tab and choose **Add key → Create new key → JSON → Create**. Google's [key creation guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) covers that separate step. Keep the downloaded JSON file outside Git, browser code, and public directories.

### Grant Search Console ownership

Verify ownership of the matching property in Search Console. Open **Settings → Users and permissions → Add user**.

Enter the service account's `client_email` in **Email address** (1). Select **Owner** under **Permission** (2), then choose **Add**. This grants delegated ownership, as required by [Google's owner setup](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/prereqs).

Being a Cloud project owner does not grant ownership of a Search Console property. Check the property covers the URL you intend to notify Google about.

## Send the first notification

Use Node.js 24 and Google's official `googleapis` client. In a new local directory, install the tested version and point the credential variable at your JSON file:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install googleapis@181.0.0
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/absolute/path/to/service-account.json"
```

Save this as `notify.mjs`:

```js
import { google } from 'googleapis'

const url = process.argv[2]
if (!url) {
  throw new Error('Pass one eligible URL: node notify.mjs URL')
}

const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/indexing'],
})
const indexing = google.indexing({ version: 'v3', auth })

await indexing.urlNotifications.publish({
  requestBody: { url, type: 'URL_UPDATED' },
}, { retry: false }).then(({ data }) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ status: 'notification-accepted', url, metadata: data }))
}).catch((error) => {
  const details = error.response?.data?.error
  console.error(JSON.stringify({
    status: 'request-failed',
    url,
    httpStatus: error.response?.status,
    reasons: details?.errors?.map(item => item.reason),
    message: details?.message ?? error.message,
  }))
  process.exitCode = 1
})
```

Run it with your eligible URL:

```bash
node notify.mjs 'https://example.com/jobs/42'
```

The example uses [GoogleAuth's credential discovery](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-nodejs) and the indexing scope. The `.mjs` extension makes the file an ES module. Replace the example URL with a page you own that meets Google's supported-content requirements.

## Read the response correctly

`notification-accepted` is the script's label for a successful API response. It does not mean the page was indexed. Google may attempt a recrawl after receiving `URL_UPDATED`; [its usage documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/using-api) defines that response.

On failure, the script prints the status, reasons, and message. Check those together: an ownership problem and an exhausted quota require different actions. The script disables automatic retries, so it does not repeatedly submit while you diagnose the problem.

Verification used the real client with intercepted HTTP responses. Credential exchange and live Google notifications remain untested. For metadata and error handling details, continue with the [Node.js guide](/google-indexing-api-node-js). For approval and rate limits, use the [quota guide](/google-indexing-api-quota).
