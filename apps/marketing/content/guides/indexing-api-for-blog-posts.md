    title: How the Google Indexing API works
---

**Ordinary blog posts are outside the Google Indexing API's supported use.** For a few new or updated posts, use Search Console's URL Inspection tool. For many URLs, submit a sitemap.

Google supports the API for pages with `JobPosting`, or `BroadcastEvent` embedded in `VideoObject`. A successful API response does not expand that scope. [Google's Indexing API quickstart](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quickstart) defines the supported content.

## What to do with a new blog post

Suppose you publish `https://example.com/blog/pruning-apple-trees`. It is an ordinary article, so you do not need an Indexing API integration for it.

1. Open the matching property in Search Console. You must be an owner or full user to request indexing.
2. Inspect the post's complete URL with the URL Inspection tool.
3. Review the status (1). For a new or updated page, choose **Request indexing** (2).

A new post may show a different status.

This follows [Google's recrawl guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/ask-google-to-recrawl). A request does not guarantee inclusion in search results. Repeating it for the same URL will not speed crawling.

If you have many posts, use a sitemap instead of repeating this process for each one. Your publishing platform may already manage a sitemap; check its documentation before adding another integration.

## Replace old sitemap ping scripts

Some older tutorials send a request to `google.com/ping` whenever a sitemap changes. Google retired that endpoint; it returns `404`.

Submit the sitemap through Search Console or reference it in `robots.txt`. If your sitemap includes `lastmod`, use the date of a significant page change. Do not advance it just to make unchanged posts appear fresh. Google's [sitemap ping retirement announcement](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/06/sitemaps-lastmod-ping) explains both changes.

## What if an API request already succeeded?

If your script sent a notification for the apple-tree post and received `200 OK`, you still need to check what happened to the page. For a `URL_UPDATED` notification, Google says a successful response means it may try to recrawl the URL soon. Crawling and indexing remain unconfirmed.

The API's metadata endpoint is also easy to misread. It reports when Google last received a notification, rather than the URL's indexing status. Both meanings are documented in [Google's API usage guide](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/using-api).

Use URL Inspection to check Google's stored index information. If you automate that check, the [URL Inspection API](https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/v1/urlInspection.index/inspect) reads the version in Google's index. It does not test the live page or provide the manual tool's request-indexing action.

## Does using a third-party tool change the answer?

No. A tool that sends Indexing API notifications still uses the same Google interface. Easier authentication or a bulk-submit button does not change which content Google supports.

Before choosing an indexing tool, check what its button does. Does it send a notification, open Search Console, or read an inspection result?

If your site also publishes eligible job listings or livestream pages, check those URLs separately from its blog. The [Google Indexing API guide](/google-indexing-api) explains that workflow and its prerequisites.

*Correction, 15 September 2026: An earlier version said the API worked for ordinary blog posts and recommended Google's retired sitemap ping endpoint. It also described unverified penalty and detection patterns. This revision removes those claims and follows Google's documented scope.*
