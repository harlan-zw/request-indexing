// Cohort comparison for "why won't Google index my site?".
//
// Google does not decline pages at random, it declines them for structural
// reasons that live in OUR crawl data rather than in GSC's taxonomy. Relaying
// GSC's own buckets ("37 crawled but not indexed") names a symptom and sends the
// developer to ChatGPT; partitioning the crawled+inspected set and asking which
// partition Google treats differently names something they can act on.
//
// The load-bearing part is the REFUTATION, not the clustering. During design,
// every compelling single-variable cluster collapsed under a controlled test:
//   - `/learn-seo/vue` looked like duplicate suppression at 23.4% vs a 14.8%
//     site rate, but 26 of its 36 near-identical `/learn-seo/nuxt` mirror pairs
//     have BOTH members indexed.
//   - "orphaned from nav" looked causal until the internal-link effect INVERTED
//     between legacy and current docs in the same section.
// So a cohort is surfaced only when its Wilson score interval clears the rate of
// its own complement — never on a point estimate. Cohorts are compared against
// the complement rather than the site-wide rate because a cohort that dominates
// the site would otherwise be validated against a baseline containing itself.
//
// Deliberately NOT dimensions: crawl depth and internal-link bands. Both failed
// the controlled test above, and every extra dimension inflates the
// multiple-comparison correction, making true findings harder to surface. They
// go back in when there is evidence, not before.
