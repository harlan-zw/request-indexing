/**
 * Runtime accessor for the pro-feature registry. Layers register features +
 * chrome via the `pro:feature` Nuxt Layer Hook from
 * `app/plugins/pro-feature.ts`. The registry is built lazily on first read
 * (cached in `useState`); contributor plugins only need to have registered
 * their listeners before the first consumer mounts, which holds by
 * construction since plugin setup runs before any component or middleware.
 *
 * Build-time `tabsByFeature` is merged here at read time — page meta is only
 * available at build time, so tabs come from the auto-generated
 * `#pro-shell/tabs` virtual.
 *
 * Aligns with `useLayerRegistry` (pro-saas) and the same pattern used by
 * `useSiteSurfaceRegistry`, `useOverviewGroupRegistry`, and `useOnboardingFlow`.
