// dashboard layouts, which ran after the page had begun rendering and never saw
// the account routes, so a half-onboarded user who opened `/account` bounced in
// a loop. The decision itself is pure and lives in
// `layers/pro-saas/shared/onboarding.ts`; this file only reads the session and
// performs the redirect.
