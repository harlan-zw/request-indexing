 * The one control that starts the Search Console grant flow.

 * Signing in with Google establishes identity only. It does not grant the
 * webmasters scopes, so `/auth/integrations/gsc/connect` is the only link that
 * repairs a disconnected account. Every surface that tells the reader to
 * connect Search Console renders this button, so no empty state can state the
 * condition without also offering the fix.
 *
 * `returnTo` defaults to the current page, which sends the reader back to the
 * surface that asked. `ConnectSearchConsoleCard` is the full dashed-card
 * variant for the dashboard front door; this one is the bare control a card or
 * an empty state places itself.
