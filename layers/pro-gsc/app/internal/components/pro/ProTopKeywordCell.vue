  <!-- `inline-block` is load-bearing. `max-width`, `overflow` and
       `text-overflow` are all ignored on a non-replaced INLINE box, so the cap
       and the `truncate` beside it were inert from the day they were written:
       a long-tail query rendered at its full intrinsic width and starved the
       sibling columns (measured at 1440: this cell 633px wide, no ellipsis,
       Query column squeezed to 86px). With the box made inline-block the cap
       binds, the ellipsis appears, and Query gets ~260px back.
       `align-bottom` pins the baseline of an overflow-hidden inline-block, which
       otherwise adds 0.5px to the row height. Full text stays in the DOM (and in
       `title`), so nothing is lost to a reader or a screen reader. -->
